# We opened the door for censorship

The single point of information access is very vulnerable against attacks as well. A total dominance of the market opens the door for censorship: It’s very hard, likely impossible to censor all web publishers. Diversity keeps a democracy strong. There will always be this one editor who does not adhere to pressure, who will publish an honest opinion, a different viewpoint, who will make room for a whistleblower. In contrast, it is very easy to censor one centralized instance. As we have seen: If Google wants to do business in China, they will adhere to the required standards. And there is no one else who will not adhere.

# Google is Cambridge Analytica on steroids

Our data profiles make us highly attackable. Google knows everything about us. In a recent study we showed that Google monitors 82% of all web-traffic. But these precise data profiles are vulnerable to misuse. The data is aggregated to profiles which can not only be used to create tailor-made advertising campaigns. They can also be used to absorb the maximum willingness to pay from every customer. And they produce the perfect medium for precision propaganda. In the best case this will just lead to us buying something we don’t need or buying something that we could get cheaper somewhere else. In the worst case they will use our fears, our secret desires to influence our political decisions. Whether Google in this game is evil or not is not the question here. It is about protecting one of our most valuable assets – information – from being owned or controlled by a monopoly.

You think Cambridge Analytica was a problem? Google is Cambridge Analytica on steroids: The manipulation potential of search engines is much higher, since users expect objective results from a search engine. Where in fact it cannot be checked whether the algorithm is actually objective (and we could have an even longer discussion that algorithms can never be objective), whether it is a personalized result (filter bubble) or whether it is used to influence us negatively. This wouldn’t be a problem if there would be many alternatives and if Google wouldn’t be so big. But due to Google’s dominant market share, even the smallest shifts in search results, even a small shift in the autosuggest, will influence our behavior.
