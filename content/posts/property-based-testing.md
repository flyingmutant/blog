- example vs property
- unit vs integration
- fscheck:
  - “Different paths, same destination” – a diagram that commutes
  - “There and back again” – an invertible function
  - “Some things never change” – an invariant under transformation
  - “The more things change, the more they stay the same” – idempotence
  - “Solve a smaller problem first” – structural induction
  - “Hard to prove, easy to verify”
  - “A test oracle”
- jessica kerr:
  - expect and create failure
  - ask hard questions
  - create visibility you need
  - define success
- math:
  - associative
  - commutative
  - distributive
  - idempotent
  - identity
  - zero
- proper
  - sit back and think
  - start broad and build up
  - assemble multiple properties
